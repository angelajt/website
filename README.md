# personal website

this is a personal website i'm building for fun, based on the [gatsby starter blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). right now the website's not online yet, but it will be located at angelajt.com.

## 🖋️ currently working on
- adding tags to blog posts

## 🛠️ need to fix
- [ ] tag pages don't generate for posts with multiple tags
- [ ] tags look super ugly right now tbh (edit in styles.css)

## 💡 ideas for the future
- replace "Twitter" etc. buttons with icons
- include a preview image in blog posts
- add portfolio section
